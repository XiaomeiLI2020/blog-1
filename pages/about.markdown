I am a [iOS and Rails software engineer](https://github.com/soffes), [musician](/music), [wanna be designer](http://dribbble.com/soffes), and burger connoisseur. I live in Lousiville, KY right now. I'll be moving back to San Francisco in the fall. I previously worked at [Hipstamatic](http://hipstamatic.com).

Now, I'm the VP of Engineering at [Seesaw](https://seesaw.co). I also work on [Cheddar](https://cheddarapp.com) in my spare time. Checkout my <%= link_to 'recent projects', projects_url %>.

When the iPhone SDK first came out in 2008, I wrote this app called [Bible](http://youversion.com/mobile) that launched day one of the App Store. There are millions of people using it now, which is really humbling. I used to own a few companies, freelanced, and worked at some startups. [Ask me about it on Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?screen_name=soffes)</a> if you're curious.

The best way to get to know me is to listen to [part 1](http://5by5.tv/founderstalk/38), [part 2](http://5by5.tv/founderstalk/39), and [part 3](http://5by5.tv/founderstalk/40) of the Founders Talk about my life, [Nothing Magical](http://nothingmagical.com), making [Cheddar](https://cheddarapp.com), and what I'm doing now.
