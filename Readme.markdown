Posts are structured with the following format:

The markdown file may contain [front matter](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/). The first `<h1>`'s text will be treated as the title of the post unless it is specified in front matter. If both are missing, the permalink is used.

Images are included in the post's folder. All image URLs are specified relative to the markdown file.

A cover image may be present. It is specified as `cover_image` in the front matter.

Tags may also be present. The are specified as a [YAML list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML#Lists) in the front matter.
